        Saving elephants
        <small class="text-muted">With the help of Artificial Intelligence</small><br><br>
    </h3>
    <p class="lead">
        The savanna elephant currently has a conservation status of ‘Vulnerable’. This is very worrying because the
        elephant is an incredible creature and should be protected at all costs due to its immense uniqueness; it really
        is a magical demonstration of what the Earth has to offer.

        <br><br>Between 2007 and 2014, Africa's savanna
        elephant population decreased by about a third and the species was set to be completely wiped out from some
        African countries within 10 years. This is because it is threatened by habitat destruction and as well as humans
        who poach them for meat and ivory.<br><br>To fix this issue, researchers turned to a cutting-edge technology
        that is changing the game for everything from
        our household appliances to our cars: artificial intelligence. AI's ability to find patterns in enormous volumes
        of information is demystifying not just elephant behavior but human behavior — specifically poacher behavior —
        too. AI can use data to tell us where elephants are, how many there are, and what they are doing.<br><br>
        The other major type of elephant in Africa is the forest elephant. These like to live beneath a thick rainforest
        canopy. This makes it very difficult to analyse their locations as they it is so easy to lose them in the
        forest. Researchers have been studying the forest elephant for years, trying to figure out how many there are
        and how fast they are being killed. Given how stealthy the forest elephants are, researchers began to think that
        rather than looking for them, they should try to listen out for them.<br><br>Researchers had 50 custom audio
        recorders made. They divided the rainforest into 25 square kilometer grids and
        headed to Central Africa. They placed one recorder in every grid square about 23 to 30 feet up in the treetops,
        just a little higher than an elephant could reach with its trunk while standing on its hind legs. And then they
        hit record. Three months later, they would return to the forest, locate the recorders, change the batteries, put
        in new audio cards, and start all over again.<br><br>As the months wore on, the recorders were collecting
        hundreds of thousands of hours of jungle sounds, thus
        making it practically difficult for a human team to listen to — which meant another problem arose: How could we
        sort through all these recordings to find the elephant voices we wanted?<br><br>That’s where AI comes in - a
        neural network is very good at this. A neural network is essentially a group of
        algorithms, or mathematical equations, working together to cluster and classify information and find patterns
        humans wouldn't necessarily see. It is particularly good at working with images, so the researchers ran the
        audio through a software program that turned the recordings collected into spectrograms — pictures of sound
        waves. They then had a company called Conservation Metrics build them a neural network that could sort through
        all the jungle sounds and find elephants.<br><br>

            alt="Responsive image">
        Each neuron in the network is determining how likely one piece
        of the spectrogram is to belong to an elephant
        call. Neurons in the first layer have just the spectrogram to consider, and so will likely recognize things like
        pitch and other things it sees as defining characteristics of elephant calls. Then the next neuron recognizes
        something else relatively simple, building on what has come before it, and so on.<br><br>When the network thinks
        it has what it needs, it makes a statistical calculation; essentially asking itself,
        what's the likelihood that the pattern I see is an elephant? 50%? 80%? Until it finally gets what it wants, that
        elephant. The neural network started producing files with lots and lots of isolated elephant sounds.<br><br>
        But then an interesting thing happened - the researchers heard something else they weren't expecting in those
        recordings: gunshots.<br><br>Assuming the gunshots were poaching attempts, they decided to build another neural
        network, this time to look
        for the sounds of gunshots, in the hope that it would provide additional information about where the forest
        elephants were being killed and perhaps even stop poachers before they fired.
