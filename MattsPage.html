		<h1>USE OF EXOSUITS IN MEDICINE</h1>
		<img src = "ironman.jpg" alt = "Tony Stark's Iron Man">
		<p>Exosuits and powered exoskeletons are wearable frames powered by various technologies to help its user perform a variety of tasks. Once seen as something limited to the realms of science fiction, these suits have actually been under experiment by the likes of the U.S Military for some time now, in order to improve itsâ€™ soldiers ability to carry out heavy labour among other things. More recently however, these suits have been applied to assist in solving a more important issue; rehabilitating those with mobility issues.</p>
		<p>Notable examples of this include:</p>

		<li><a href ="https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/features/hal-japanese-cyborg-medical-exoskeleton-helping-us-patients-walk/">Cyberdyne's HAL exo-skeleton</a> helping patients in the US deal with lower limb disorders</li>
		<li>Clinatec and the University of Grenoble collaborating to trial a <a href ="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-49907356">mind-controlled exoskeleton</a> to help patients suffering from paralysis</li>
		<li><a href ="https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/projects/restore-exo-suit/">ReWalk Robotics' ReStore soft exoskeleton</a> being used to treat patients recovering from strokes</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<p>The implementation of these technologies in the medical field show a lot of promise in their potential to change the way we treat patients with mobility issues and stand as a testement to the positive impacts that computer science and robotics can have on our society. </p>
