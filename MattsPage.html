		<h1>USE OF EXOSUITS IN MEDICINE</h1>
		<img src = "ironman.jpg" alt = "Tony Stark's Iron Man">
		<p>Exosuits (powered exo-skeletons) are wearable frame powered by various technologies in order to improve the users ability to carry out tasks. They originally started out as a project by the U.S. military but are now having a big impact within the medical field, sepcifically in helping to rehabilitate people with mobility issues.</p>
		<p>Notable examples of this include:</p>
		<div id="list">
		<ul>
		<li><a href ="https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/features/hal-japanese-cyborg-medical-exoskeleton-helping-us-patients-walk/">Cyberyne's HAL exo-skeleton</a> helping patients in the US deal with lower limb disorders</li>
		<li>Clinatec and the University of Grenoble collaborating to trial a <a href ="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-49907356">mind-controlled exoskeleton</a> to help patients suffering from paralysis</li>
		<li><a href ="https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/projects/restore-exo-suit/">ReWalk Robotics' ReStore soft exoskeleton</a> being used to treat patients recovering from strokes</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<p>The implementation of these technologies in the medical field show a lot of promise in their potential to change the way we treat patients with mobility issues and stand as a testement to the positive impacts that computer science and robotics can have on our society. </p>
